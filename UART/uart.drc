WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net R/s_RST_AND_3_o is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
DRC detected 0 errors and 1 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
